### Virtual Environment

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies. Follow these steps to create a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
```
```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
```
